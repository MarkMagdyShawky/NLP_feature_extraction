In this project, we aim to classify news articles as either fake or real by building machine learning and deep learning models. To achieve accurate and reliable results, we followed a systematic approach that includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling.
1.	Data Preprocessing: -
Before feeding the data into any model, we cleaned and normalized the text to improve the quality of the input. 
2. Feature Extraction
After preprocessing, we transformed the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. 
 3. Modeling
We experimented with a range of models to classify the news articles:
4 Machine Learning models and 2 Deep Learning models.
